# UltraCalc

A simple little tool to calculate cycling speeds based on various parameters for given GPX files.

## Description

Solves differential equations for a simple cycling model.
Parameters include weight, air resistance (state dependent i.e. aero tuck on flats), rolling resistance, power (state dependent, i.e. more power uphill than downhill), wind (currently only static)

## Getting Started

Take a look at test.py for a sample experiment (takes a few minutes to run).
All units are SI metric.
